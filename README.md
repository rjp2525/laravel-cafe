## About Laravel Cafe

![Cafe Screenshot][product-screenshot]

In the past, I've worked on a lot of applications that required some sort of forum or discussion board attached to it. Though I don't really use them myself anymore, I figured it would be a great opportunity to get involved with Laravel open-source package development and potentially make someone else's life easier.

It's coming soon, but some things you can expect:

- The basics of a forum - categories, subcategories, topics, replies
- Integration with roles and permissions
- Configurable routes
- A Vue.js and Tailwind frontend to get you started

Check back soon for updates!
